- FlexibleLineRenderer

    By default, the line renderer in Unity is a poorly flexible component with thousands of limitations:

    - a GameObject can have only one LineRenderer
    - it doesn't follow the positions of the extrema points

    This script provides a implementation of a simple line bounding and following two GameObjects, updatig position, style, and much more, at runtime.
