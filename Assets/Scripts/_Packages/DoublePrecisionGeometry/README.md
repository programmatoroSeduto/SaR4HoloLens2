# Unity Package - DoublePrecisionGeometry

*A se of utilities for high-precision computations with some common vectors.*

Sometimes the *float* datatype, usen in literally *every part of the Unity API*, is not sufficient. The geolocation is a clear example of this: the numerical precision should be as higher as possible in order to be able to perform computations.
